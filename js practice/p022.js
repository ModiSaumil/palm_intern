// Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, determine whether the are two distinct indices and in the array where nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between 1 and jis less than or equal to k

// Example

// For nuns [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2] and 3, the output

// should be

// contains CloseNums (nums, k) = true

// There are two 2 s in nums, and the absolute difference

// between their positions is exactly 3
